# How to Deploy Your AI Crop Recommendation System Online (For Free!)

Hey! üëã 

So you want to put your AI Crop Recommendation System online? Great! This guide will walk you through deploying it completely free. No credit card needed, no monthly costs.

## What We're Going to Deploy

We'll put your app on these free platforms:
- **Vercel** - Hosts your website (free forever)
- **Railway** - Hosts your backend and AI service (free tier)
- **MongoDB Atlas** - Your database (free tier)

Total cost: **$0/month** üéâ

## Quick Start (Easiest Way)

If you want to get it done fast:

```bash
./deploy-online.sh
```

This script will guide you through everything. Just follow the prompts!

## Manual Deployment (Step by Step)

Want to understand what's happening? Let's do it step by step:

### Step 1: Set Up Your Database First

Before we deploy anything, let's get your database ready:

1. **Go to MongoDB Atlas**: https://www.mongodb.com/atlas
2. **Sign up** (it's free)
3. **Create a new cluster** (choose the free M0 tier)
4. **Wait for it to finish** (takes a few minutes)
5. **Get your connection string**:
   - Click "Connect" on your cluster
   - Choose "Connect your application"
   - Copy the connection string (looks like: `mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/`)

**Save this connection string** - you'll need it later!

### Step 2: Deploy Your Frontend to Vercel

Vercel is perfect for React apps and it's free:

1. **Install Vercel CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Deploy your frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   vercel login
   vercel --prod
   ```

3. **Follow the prompts**:
   - Link to existing project? **No**
   - Project name? **crop-recommendation-frontend** (or whatever you want)
   - Directory? **./** (just press Enter)

4. **Get your frontend URL** (looks like: `https://crop-recommendation-frontend.vercel.app`)

**Save this URL** - you'll need it for the backend!

### Step 3: Deploy Your Backend to Railway

Railway is great for Node.js apps:

1. **Install Railway CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   ```

2. **Deploy your backend**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   railway login
   railway init
   railway up
   ```

3. **Follow the prompts**:
   - Project name? **crop-recommendation-backend**
   - Environment? **Production**

4. **Get your backend URL** (looks like: `https://crop-recommendation-backend-production.up.railway.app`)

**Save this URL** - you'll need it for the AI service!

### Step 4: Deploy Your AI Service to Railway

Same process, different service:

1. **Deploy your AI service**:
   ```bash
   cd ai-service
   railway init
   railway up
   ```

2. **Follow the prompts**:
   - Project name? **crop-recommendation-ai**
   - Environment? **Production**

3. **Get your AI service URL** (looks like: `https://crop-recommendation-ai-production.up.railway.app`)

### Step 5: Connect Everything Together

Now we need to tell each service where to find the others:

#### Update Frontend Environment Variables

In your Vercel dashboard:
1. Go to your project settings
2. Click "Environment Variables"
3. Add these:
   - `REACT_APP_API_URL` = `https://your-backend-url.railway.app`
   - `REACT_APP_AI_SERVICE_URL` = `https://your-ai-service-url.railway.app`

#### Update Backend Environment Variables

In your Railway dashboard (backend project):
1. Go to "Variables" tab
2. Add these:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/crop-recommendation
   JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-key-here
   FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend-url.vercel.app
   AI_SERVICE_URL=https://your-ai-service-url.railway.app
   ```

#### Update AI Service Environment Variables

In your Railway dashboard (AI service project):
1. Go to "Variables" tab
2. Add these:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend-url.railway.app
   FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend-url.vercel.app
   ```

### Step 6: Test Everything

Now let's make sure everything works:

1. **Visit your frontend URL** (the Vercel one)
2. **Try to register** a new account
3. **Try to login**
4. **Try the chat** feature
5. **Check if AI responses** work

If something doesn't work, don't worry - we'll fix it in the troubleshooting section below.

## What Happens with AI?

Since Railway doesn't have GPUs, Ollama won't work there. But that's okay! Your system will automatically use **demo mode**:

- ‚úÖ **Pre-written crop recommendations** (still helpful!)
- ‚úÖ **Sample chat responses** (still works!)
- ‚úÖ **No API keys needed** (completely free!)

If you want real AI later, you can:
1. Get free OpenAI credits
2. Update the AI service to use OpenAI instead of Ollama
3. Redeploy

## Troubleshooting

### "My frontend won't load"
- Check if Vercel deployment succeeded
- Look at Vercel logs for errors
- Make sure environment variables are set

### "I can't register/login"
- Check if backend is running (visit your backend URL + `/health`)
- Check backend environment variables
- Make sure MongoDB connection string is correct

### "AI responses are empty"
- This is normal! The system uses demo mode
- Check AI service logs in Railway
- Make sure AI service environment variables are set

### "Database connection failed"
- Double-check your MongoDB connection string
- Make sure your IP is whitelisted in MongoDB Atlas
- Check if the database name is correct

### "CORS errors"
- Make sure `FRONTEND_URL` is set correctly in backend
- Check that the URL matches exactly (including https://)

## Deployment Checklist
